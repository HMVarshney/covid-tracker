                <p>A novel strain of coronavirus — SARS-CoV-2 — was 
                    first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, a city in China’s Hubei 
                    province with a population of 11 million, after an outbreak of 
                    pneumonia without an obvious cause. The virus has now spread to over 
                    200 countries and territories across the globe, and was characterised 
                    as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.
                    This app has been created to give a clear picture of the situation world-wide and
                    in your country.</p>
                    <p>Stay Home! Stay Safe! Hope we all rise from this pandemic and become the better
                        version of ourselves.</p>
